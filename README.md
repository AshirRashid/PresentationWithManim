# PresentationWithManim
Manim is not recommended for projects other than those which cannot be completed with the help of other more specific, use-friendly and well-documented tools. And after completing this project, I am convinced.

I still can't believe how I convinced myself that this was a good idea.

The svg files have not been included since they were irrelevant to the purpose of this repo.
